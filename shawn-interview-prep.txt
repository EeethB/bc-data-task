Dealt with conflict
  Group needed, e.g. 15%
  VP of Sales said 10%
  I really thought 15 was appropriate
  In meeting, since my responsibility is rating, I voiced my concern
  We disagreed, chief actuary went with Sales, I accepted
  Later, I discussed with chief actuary, he pointed out some information I hadn't considered, and I changed my position

A time I failed
  A few months into my current job, I was doing a monthly update to a claims dashboard for some of our groups. Our portion of the update was built in Excel, across multiple files. A cell in an upstream file moved, and when I updated downstream, I didn't catch it. I also did not submit it for review before pushing updated data out to the dashboard. Once I discovered the error, I notified the Chief Actuary and owned up to the error, but not before it had an external impact. It really helped impress upon me the importance of checks in your work. Whether those are thoughtfully designed, automated checks that alert you to anomalies, or live review by someone with more domain knowledge than you, it's important to have some backup on data quality.

Biggest professional achievement
  The risk adjustment program requires health insurance issuers to submit claims information to the federal government. The government determines risk disparities between issuers, then transfers funds to account for risk differences. These payments can run into the millions of dollars for a single line of business. When I inherited the data QA of this process, there was little clear ownership of the different pieces. After I took ownership of scheduling, coordination between departments, and quality assurance of the data, we got ahead of regulatory deadlines, had a more robust checking process, and ultimately saved millions of dollars each year by getting a more clear picture of our risk.
