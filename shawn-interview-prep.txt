Dealt with conflict
  Group needed, e.g. 15%
  VP of Sales said 10%
  I really thought 15 was appropriate
  In meeting, since my responsibility is rating, I voiced my concern
  We disagreed, chief actuary went with Sales, I accepted
  Later, I discussed with chief actuary, he pointed out some information I hadn't considered, and I changed my position

A time I failed
  A few months into my current job, I was doing a monthly update to a claims dashboard for some of our groups. Our portion of the update was built in Excel, across multiple files. A cell in an upstream file moved, and when I updated downstream, I didn't catch it. I also did not submit it for review before pushing updated data out to the dashboard. Once I discovered the error, I notified the Chief Actuary and owned up to the error, but not before it had an external impact. It really helped impress upon me the importance of checks in your work. Whether those are thoughtfully designed, automated checks that alert you to anomalies, or live review by someone with more domain knowledge than you, it's important to have some backup on data quality.

Biggest professional achievement
  The risk adjustment program requires health insurance issuers to submit claims information to the federal government. The government determines risk disparities between issuers, then transfers funds to account for risk differences. These payments can run into the millions of dollars for a single line of business. When I inherited the data QA of this process, there was little clear ownership of the different pieces. After I took ownership of scheduling, coordination between departments, and quality assurance of the data, we got ahead of regulatory deadlines, had a more robust checking process, and ultimately saved millions of dollars each year by getting a more clear picture of our risk.

Leadership style

Bandcamp seeks an experienced analyst to lead our small data team. With your superlative communication skills and expertise interpreting real-world data, you’ll help define research questions and provide empirical answers to those questions, while steering the development of our nascent data practice.

Bandcamp is a global music community where fans discover great music and directly support the artists who make it. We believe that music is an indispensable part of culture, and for that culture to thrive, artists—no matter their identity, community, or genre—must be compensated fairly and transparently for their work.

You will:

  - Guide development of the team’s vision, oversee its projects, and shepherd its standards and processes.
  - Work with all teams and types to shape and answer a delightfully diverse range   of questions.
  - Work especially closely with the product and design teams to understand the vagaries of user behavior.
  - Engineer pragmatic analytic approaches in R and SQL, improving our toolkit along the way.
  - Present results in lucid, engaging prose, variously supported by tables and visualizations.
  - Help design, engineer, and maintain dashboards, reports, and data pipelines.
  - Spelunk application code and database schema to better understand what is represented where (and why).


You have:
  - Experience leading a team, and an interest in developing or strengthening your people management skills (formal management experience welcome but  not required).
  - The ability to convey occasionally esoteric technical concerns in an illuminating way, to virtually anyone with any background.
  - Broad knowledge of practical statistical methods (and pitfalls), coupled with serene analytic reasoning abilities.
  - 3+ years of real-world analysis and engineering experience with SQL, R,   and Python.
  - Experience working closely with a non-technical team that made use of   your analyses.
