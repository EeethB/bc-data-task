## The task

Using just historical sale data, we'd like to be able to answer a few specific questions:

  * What's the average individual purchase rate of users across the site?
  * Is there a common tendency in individual purchasing rates over time?
  * Has that common tendency itself changed over time?

Imagine the raw historical sale data are stored in a schema that looks like this:

  * Each sale is represented by an individual row in a table called `sales`. Columns include `sale_id`, `sale_date`, `buyer_email_address`, `num_items`, and `total_usd`.
  * For the purposes of this exercise, you can assume that if someone makes multiple purchases, they use the same email address each time.

Work your magic:

  1. Describe the final form (or forms) of what you might produce from the raw sale data, and how it all would address the primary questions.
  2. Describe (in writing) each step of the algorithmic process by which you would transform the raw data into that final form. Though you should assume you are engineering your hypothetical routine in R or Python, at this point we are not so much interested in particularities of code as we are in the conceptual steps by which you would aggregate, manipulate, and generally structure the data as you go along. Where relevant, detail any important design decisions or judgment calls you make, or where having more information could help.
  3. Explain everything in #1 and #2 again (!), but this time much simpler: keep the whole thing to just a few sentences about the essence of what is going on.
  4. In what ways could the final data be misinterpreted? What are the benefits and limitations of thinking in terms of an "average purchase rate" in the first place?
